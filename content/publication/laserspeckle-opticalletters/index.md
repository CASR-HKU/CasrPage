abstract: "
Micro motion estimation has important applications in various fields such as microfluidic particle detection and biomedical cell imaging. Conventional methods analyze the motion from intensity images captured using frame-based imaging sensors such as the complementary metalâ€“oxide semiconductor (CMOS) and the charge-coupled device (CCD). Recently, event-based sensors have evolved with the special capability to record asynchronous light changes with high dynamic range, high temporal resolution, low latency, and no motion blur. In this Letter, we explore the potential of using the event sensor to estimate the micro motion based on the laser speckle correlation technique.
