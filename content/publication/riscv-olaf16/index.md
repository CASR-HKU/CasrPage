abstract: "
FPGA overlays are commonly implemented as coarse-grained reconfigurable architectures with a goal to improve designers\u2019 productivity through balancing flexibility and ease of configuration of the underlying fabric. To truly facilitate full application acceleration, it is often necessary to also include a highly efficient processor that integrates and collaborates with the accelerators while maintaining the benefits of being implemented within the same overlay framework.
