abstract: "
Due to the irregular nature of connections in most graph datasets, partitioning graph analysis algorithms across multiple computational nodes that do not share a common memory inevitably leads to large amounts of interconnect traffic. Previous research has shown that FPGAs can outcompete software-based graph processing in shared memory contexts, but it remains an open question if this advantage can be maintained in distributed systems.
