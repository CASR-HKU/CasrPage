Ho-Cheung graduated from The University of Hong Kong as an M.Phil student under the supervision of Prof. Hayden So. He worked on design portability for FPGA where he proposed the use of a virtual memory system to achieve autonomous access to the system memory from the FPGA. He also researched the use of a portable soft processor to provide control over FPGA overlay. Finally, he was responsible for the data collection system for ATOM images with the use of FPGA. Ho-Cheung is now a final year Ph.D. student at Imperial College London, UK.
