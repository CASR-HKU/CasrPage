Junying Chen graduated from The University of Hong Kong under the supervision of Dr. Hayden So and Prof. Victor Li in 2013. She worked on the design space exploration of real-time bedside and portable medical ultrasound adaptive beamformer acceleration. This work gave a good tradeoff insight about algorithm design and application acceleration using FPGA and GPU. She has been with the School of Software Engineering at South China University of Technology after graduation, where she is currently an [associate professor](http://www2.scut.edu.cn/sse/2018/0614/c16789a270666/page.htm). Her research interests include artificial intelligence especially accurate and compact deep learning algorithms, medical imaging especially high-quality and real-time medical ultrasound imaging, medical image processing, and high-performance computing.
