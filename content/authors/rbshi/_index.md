Runbin Shi is a Ph.D. student of parallel computing at the University of Hong Kong under the supervision of Prof. Hayden So and Prof. Edmund Lam. His research interest is FPGA overlay, which delivers the FPGA accelerators with an architecture-compilation co-design for particular domains, including image super-resolution, machine learning inference, and structured sparse tensor contraction.
