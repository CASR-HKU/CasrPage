Recent advances in high-throughput cell microscopy promise a new generation of image-based biomedical applications, e.g., cell sorting and classification, otherwise impossible with traditional biomolecular assays.
As the prior art in the cytometry technique, [ATOM system](https://www.eee.hku.hk/~alphahku/wordpress/research/) (as illustrated in **FIG.1**) is a home-built optical microscopy for cell flow imaging by [our colleborator](https://www.eee.hku.hk/~alphahku). 
One **challenge** with this system, however, is that we must derive adequate information from the cell images in realtime to facilitate various forms of image analytics while avoiding signiÔ¨Åcant impact on the overall imaging throughput.

As **FIG.1**, the cell flow imaging adopts the line scan technique, where the periodic laser pulse shines through the cell tunnel, and each pulse encodes an image line to the *time-stretched* signal. 
Subsequently, a digitizer (ADC) samples the continuous signal in an ultra-high-speed **(5 Giga samples per second)**, which still limits the imaging resolution. Hence, this research investigates a **realtime** super-resolution (SR) scheme for the ATOM system under the speed limitation of ADC.

We proposed a novel technique, **coprime line scan super-resolution (CLSS)**, for not only ATOM microscopy but also imaging systems with a similar mechanism.
Further, we designed **FPGA** based hardware architecture for CLSS that reaches a realtime processing throughput of **5 Gigapixels per second**, which is scarcely possible on other platforms.
The realtime super-resolution on FPGA facilitates the subsequent image-based cell classification and sorting. 
**FIG.2** demonstrates cell images for comparison. These images were sampled with the same ADC frequency, but different reconstruction schemes: (1) original sampling without SR; (2) with conventional rectilinear SR (interpolation); (3)-(5) with different options in CLSS sampling scheme.
