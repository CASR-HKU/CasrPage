Past research and implementation efforts have shown that FPGAs are efficient at processing many graph algorithms. However, they are notoriously hard to program, leading to impractically long development times even for simple applications. We propose a vertex-centric framework for graph processing on FPGAs, providing a base execution model and distributed architecture so that developers need only write very small application kernels.
