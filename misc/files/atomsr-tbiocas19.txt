A fundamental technical challenge for ultra-fast cell microscopy is the tradeoff between imaging throughput and resolution. In addition to throughput, real-time applications such as image-based cell sorting further requires ultra-low imaging latency to facilitate rapid decision making on a single-cell level. Using a novel coprime line scan sampling scheme, a real-time low-latency hardware super-resolution system for ultra-fast time-stretch microscopy is presented. The proposed scheme utilizes analog-to-digital converter with a carefully tuned sampling pattern (shifted sampling grid) to enable super-resolution image reconstruction using line scan input from an optical front-end. A fully pipelined FPGA-based system is built to efficiently handle the real-time high-resolution image reconstruction process with the input subpixel samples while achieving minimal output latency. The proposed super-resolution sampling and reconstruction scheme is parametrizable and is readily applicable to different line scan imaging systems. In our experiments, an imaging latency of 0.29 Î¼s has been achieved based on a pixel-stream throughput of 4.123 giga pixels per second, which translates into imaging throughput of approximately 120000 cells per second.
